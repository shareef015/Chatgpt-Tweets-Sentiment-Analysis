Problem Definition:

The problem for this data science project is to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to ChatGPT. The goal is to classify the sentiment of the tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. The analysis will also involve exploring the tweets based on various time-based attributes such as week, day, hour, and minute, to gain insights into the temporal patterns of sentiment.

EDA for Week, Day, Hour, Minute:

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the tweets' sentiment analysis will involve analyzing the data based on different time-based attributes. This can be done by extracting the relevant time-based information from the timestamp of each tweet, and then aggregating and visualizing the sentiment distribution based on these attributes. For example, the tweets can be grouped by week, day, hour, or minute, and the sentiment distribution (positive, negative, or neutral) can be plotted using bar charts or pie charts to observe any patterns or trends.

Sentiment Analysis using NLTK:

To perform sentiment analysis, the NLTK library can be used, which is a popular Python library for natural language processing tasks. The NLTK library provides various tools and resources for text analysis, including sentiment analysis. The tweets can be preprocessed by cleaning and tokenizing the text, and then sentiment analysis can be performed using NLTK's pre-trained sentiment analyzer, such as the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) sentiment analyzer. The VADER analyzer can classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories based on the presence of positive or negative words, intensity of sentiment, and other contextual features. The sentiment analysis results can then be used for further analysis, visualization, and interpretation of the tweets' sentiment distribution.
